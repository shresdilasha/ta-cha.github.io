            <p>In a surprising turn of events, ads have become Big Tech’s Achilles’ heel. Google’s ad revenue grew just
              3% this quarter, down from 43% growth a year ago. For the first time, YouTube ad revenue...</p>

            <p> Rupert is proof that it’s never too late to find a new source of awe/ that when you find something you
              love, you don’t care how silly it makes you look or what other people think about it/ that perhaps
              everyday life is full of untapped passion, and should I be excited by all the potentialities, or depressed

      <h1>Living Boundaries</h1>
      <p>Our boundaries are often created in response to specific external conditions. Maybe it was because a person or
        a situation is causing us a lot of distress. It worked. The problem is, time moved on.</p>

      <p>When you were in your 20s or 30s, what age seemed “old” and what did you imagine it’d be like to be “old”? And
        what do you think about being older now?</p>

      <p>I like being a second-time founder.It’s like having your second kid. You don’t sweat the small stuff because
        you know what the small stuff actually is. You feel more confident in your instincts and rely on your gut more
        than your hyperactive mind and what other hyperactive minds around you tell you.</p>

      <p>For most of the modern era, most people in the rich world have been poor, just like their parents and their
        children. Social mobility was more dream than reality. Most people were born to serve, as were their children.

      <p>Everybody wants to be seen. The drive is unavoidably hammered into our DNA. But capturing anyone’s attention,
        even for a moment, is quite the challenge these days. So, it’s no surprise to see the extremes people go to
        satisfy this hard-wired need.</p>
